# my-first-solana-project-series-II-part-12

## In this video we learn how to  
- pass in command-line arguments to a Rust main.rs
- convert an ascii string to bytes so as to pass them to the Solana "entrypoint" function
- in the entrypoint function (in lib.rs) we then convert the bytes back into an ascii string
- have the on-chain program-to-be (lib.rs) begin to make decisions based on the cmd-line value passed in
